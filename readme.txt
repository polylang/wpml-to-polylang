= How to proceed? =

* De-activate WPML
* Activate Polylang or [Polylang Pro](https://polylang.pro) and WPML to Polylang. Do **not** create any language with Polylang (they will be imported).
* Go to Tools -> WPML Importer.
* If all checks are passed, then you can click on 'Import'.
* De-activate WPML to Polylang (You can even delete it).
* Setup a language switcher either as a widget or in nav menus.
* Check that everything is OK.
* If something went wrong and you want to revert to WPML, you can delete Polylang using the red link in the Plugins table. To delete all data created for Polylang, Please read [how](https://polylang.pro/doc/how-to-uninstall-polylang/) **before** deleting Polylang. Finally you can re-activate WPML.

= Notes =

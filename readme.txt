Import multilingual data from WPML into Polylang.

== Description ==

= Features =

* Imports languages and WPML options (when the same options exist in Polylang)
* Imports posts and terms languages as well as translations (including for custom post types and custom taxonomies)
* Imports multilingual nav menus
* Imports strings translations
* Does not delete WPML data

= Important =

Although WPML data should not be corrupted, as Polylang data are created without deleting anything, **make a database backup before proceeding**.

= How to proceed? =

* De-activate WPML
* Activate [Polylang](https://polylang.pro) and WPML to Polylang. Do *not* create any language with Polylang.
* Go in Tools -> WPML Importer
* If all checks are passed, you can click on 'Import'
* De-activate WPML to Polylang (you can even delete it)
* Setup a language switcher either as a widget or in nav menus
* Check that everything is OK
* If something went wrong and you want to revert to WPML, you can delete Polylang using the red link in Plugins table (it will delete all data created for Polylang) and then re-activate WPML

= Notes =

This plugin is still experimental and does not include error management. I tested successfully to migrate a small site from WPML 2.0.4.1. I did not test newer versions of WPML, but a user reported a successful migration from WPML 3.1.5. Multisite has not been tested either. Thanks to report your experience (successful or not) with different versions of WPML in the support forum.
